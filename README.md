20 Days of Python - My Data Structures & Algorithms Journey
Welcome to my repository! This project documents my progress and solutions from a 20-day intensive Python training program focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Over these 20 days, I challenged myself to solve a variety of problems, strengthening my foundational programming and problem-solving skills.

ðŸš€ About This Project:

This repository serves as a personal logbook of my learning journey. It contains the code I wrote, the concepts I explored, and the solutions I developed for a wide range of DSA topics. The primary goal was to move from theoretical knowledge to practical application, and each file represents a step forward in that journey.

ðŸ“š Topics Covered:

I delved into numerous core concepts essential for software development and technical interviews. The repository is structured by topic, making it easy to navigate to specific areas.

Here are the key areas I covered:

ðŸ§± Data Structures
Arrays: Core operations and problem-solving patterns.

Linked Lists: Implementation of singly linked lists and loop detection.

Stacks: LIFO principle applied to problems like parenthesis balancing.

Trees: In-depth exploration of traversals (BFS, DFS) and Binary Search Trees.

Graphs: Weighted graph representations and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

Trie: Specialized tree structure for efficient prefix-based searching.

ðŸ§  Algorithms
Searching: Mastery of Linear and Binary Search, including applications in 2D matrices.

Sorting: Implementation and analysis of Bubble Sort and Merge Sort.

Recursion & Backtracking: Tackling complex combinatorial problems like Rat in a Maze and Subset Sum.

Dynamic Programming: Optimizing recursive solutions with memoization and tabulation (e.g., Coin Change, Longest Palindromic Subsequence).

Greedy Algorithms: Making locally optimal choices for problems like Job Scheduling.

Sliding Window: An efficient technique for array and string problems.

Two-Pointer Technique: A powerful method for optimizing solutions.

fundamentals
Time Complexity Analysis: Evaluating the efficiency of code using Big O notation.

Problem-Solving Patterns: Identifying and applying common patterns to tackle new challenges.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The code is organized into folders, with each folder dedicated to a specific data structure or algorithmic concept. The file names within each folder are descriptive of the problem they solve.

âœ¨ What's Next?
Completing this 20-day challenge has been an incredible learning experience. My next steps are to:

Continue solving problems on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.

Apply these DSA concepts to build larger, more complex projects.

Dive deeper into advanced algorithms and system design principles.
