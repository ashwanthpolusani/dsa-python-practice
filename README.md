20 Days of Python - My Data Structures & Algorithms Journey
Welcome to my repository! This project documents my progress and solutions from a 20-day intensive Python training program focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Over these 20 days, I challenged myself to solve a variety of problems, strengthening my foundational programming and problem-solving skills.

ðŸš€ About This Project:

This repository serves as a personal logbook of my learning journey. It contains the code I wrote, the concepts I explored, and the solutions I developed for a wide range of DSA topics. The primary goal was to move from theoretical knowledge to practical application, and each file represents a step forward in that journey.

ðŸ“š **Topics Covered**

I delved into numerous core concepts essential for software development and technical interviews. The repository is structured by topic, making it easy to navigate to specific areas.

### ðŸ§± **Data Structures**
- **Arrays**: Core operations, problem-solving patterns
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked lists, loop detection
- **Stacks**: LIFO, parenthesis balancing
- **Trees**: Traversals (BFS, DFS), Binary Search Trees
- **Graphs**: Weighted graphs, Dijkstra's algorithm
- **Trie**: Efficient prefix-based searching

### ðŸ§  **Algorithms**
- **Searching**: Linear & Binary Search (1D & 2D)
- **Sorting**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort
- **Recursion & Backtracking**: Rat in a Maze, Subset Sum
- **Dynamic Programming**: Coin Change, Longest Palindromic Subsequence
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Job Scheduling, Lemonade Change
- **Sliding Window**: Efficient array/string processing
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: Optimized solutions

### ðŸ“– **Fundamentals**
- **Time Complexity Analysis**: Big O notation
- **Problem-Solving Patterns**: Common approaches for new challenges

âœ¨ What's Next?
Completing this 20-day challenge has been an incredible learning experience. My next steps are to:

Continue solving problems on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.

Apply these DSA concepts to build larger, more complex projects.

Dive deeper into advanced algorithms and system design principles.
