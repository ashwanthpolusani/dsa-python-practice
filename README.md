20 Days of Python - My Data Structures & Algorithms Journey
Welcome to my repository! This project documents my progress and solutions from a 20-day intensive Python training program focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Over these 20 days, I challenged myself to solve a variety of problems, strengthening my foundational programming and problem-solving skills.

🚀 About This Project
This repository serves as a personal logbook of my learning journey. It contains the code I wrote, the concepts I explored, and the solutions I developed for a wide range of DSA topics. The primary goal was to move from theoretical knowledge to practical application, and each file represents a step forward in that journey.

📚 Topics Covered
I delved into numerous core concepts essential for software development and technical interviews. The repository is structured by topic, making it easy to navigate to specific areas.

Here are the key areas I covered:

Data Structures:

Arrays

Linked Lists

Stacks

Graphs 

Trees (DFS, BFS, Binary Search Trees)

Trie

Algorithms:

Searching (Linear, Binary Search in 1D & 2D arrays)

Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort)

Recursion & Backtracking (Rat in a Maze, Subset Sum)

Dynamic Programming (Coin Change, Longest Palindromic Subsequence)

Greedy Algorithms (Job Scheduling, Lemonade Change)

Sliding Window Technique

Two-Pointer Technique

Fundamentals:

Time Complexity Analysis

Problem-Solving Patterns

📂 Repository Structure
The code is organized into folders, with each folder dedicated to a specific data structure or algorithmic concept. The file names within each folder are descriptive of the problem they solve.

💻 How to Use This Repository
You can clone this repository to your local machine to review the solutions or test the code.

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)

Navigate to a specific folder:

cd your-repository-name/data_structures/arrays/

Run a Python file:

python array_find_element.py

✨ What's Next?
Completing this 20-day challenge has been an incredible learning experience. My next steps are to:

Continue solving problems on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.

Apply these DSA concepts to build larger, more complex projects.

Dive deeper into advanced algorithms and system design principles.
